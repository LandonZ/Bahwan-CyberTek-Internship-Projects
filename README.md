# Bahwan Cybertek Internship Code - Summer 2024

I, Landon Zheng, was a Software Engineer Intern for Bahwan CyberTek in Summer 2024, located in Taipei, Taiwan.

Located in this repository, I have uploaded the code (with proper redaction) for my projects as an intern, a Recommendation Letter from the General Manager of BCT, an Internship Certificate, and the presentation I used to present my projects to the company.

As an intern, I served two roles, and developed three projects:

<u>**Data Migration Specialist | Python**</u>

**Project 1, Data Migration for Software:**  I performed data migration for application projects being developed inside Bahwan Cybertek, using RESTful APIs and AWS Buckets. One of the projects I completed was transferring real-time GPS data into a mobile fitness app, and storing this data inside a database in order to map out the path of the user.

<u>**Generative AI Software Engineer | JavaScript, Flowise**</u>

Using Flowise, a tool to produce personalized Generative AI projects served for a specific purpose, I produced two software applications for internal company uses. Note these projects are exported in JSON format, and can be imported back into the Flowise software.

Custom tools are also in JSON format. These are scripts that the AI can leverage in order to do a specified purpose, such as get or add data from a database.

**Project 2, AI-Powered Employee Leave Records Software:** I developed a Generative AI Software Application that improved the employee leave record system. Employees are able to chat to an AI about when they will leave, the duration, the leave type, etc. to check their available leave days as well as schedule a leave day within a database. This application utilizes Retrieval Augmented Generation from an Airtable database to link the AI to the Employee leave records.

**Project 3, AI-Powered Invoice Processing Software:** I developed another Generative AI Software Application to process BCT company invoices and automatically add them to the company's financial statement. I trained the AI model based off the format of invoices, and thus, given a picture of an invoice, the model would be able to identify the purchase name, the name of the company, and the amount paid, then add this information into the financial statement sheet.
